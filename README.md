2. Click the `File` menu, choose `Add Existing Application...` and browse to the folder with the `app.yaml` and `main.py` file.

3. The project ID should appear as a row at the `Name` column.

4. Click `Deploy`, enter your Google credentials, and your app should be installed to Google's servers.

5. Open your Telegram client and send the message `/start` to your bot. (type @`your-bot-username` at the search field to initiate the conversation)

30. You can, for example, send `what time` to the bot and the bot will reply you. Try sending `/image` as well. Mission completed!

To customize the bot, edit the `main.py`
